<h1>Hey, I'm Angeliki! (AKA @ScoopySnack) ðŸ˜„</h1> 

I'm an aspiring developer with a curious mind and a passion for Artificial Intelligence! 
Currently diving deep into Python, Java, and all things web development (HTML/CSS). When I'm not coding, I'm learning about AI, software testing, or figuring out how to make my code even cleaner. ðŸ˜Ž

ðŸŒ± Currently exploring: JavaScript and how to make cool things with AI.

ðŸ’¬ Always open to new ideas, collaborations, and fun coding challenges!
